    <h1>Firefox Nightly</h1>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Firefox Nightly</strong> is the cutting-edge version of the popular Mozilla Firefox web browser. It's more or less designed for <strong>early adopters</strong> and <strong>developers</strong> who want to experience the latest features and improvements before they're released to the general public. Nightly builds are updated <strong>daily</strong>, hence the name Nightly, and it provides a glimpse into the <strong>future of web browsing</strong>. It should be noted that while it may be less stable than the regular Firefox version, it still offers a neat opportunity to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly">test new features and report bugs</a> to help improve the browser.
